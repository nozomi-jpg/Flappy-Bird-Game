# Flappy-Bird-Game

The Flappy Bird game is a straightforward yet captivating arcade-style game created as a Windows Forms program using C#. This game involves navigating a bird through a sequence of upright pipes byÂ clicking to prompt the bird to "flap" and evade any collisions with the pipes. The goal is to maneuver through the pipes and get the maximum achievable score.

Bird Control: The bird goes up when the player initiates a key press, and is subject to the force of gravity, causing it to descend when no action is detected.

Pipe Obstacles: Pipes are consistently generated at fixed intervals, passing from the right to the screen's left side. The player has to navigate the bird through the openings in the pipes.

Collision Detection: The game identifies instances where the bird comes into contact with either the pipes or the ground. The game ends if a collision happens.
